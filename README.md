### Vue Mastery Courses

I am working through the [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/) online 
courses (by Gregg Pollack and Adam Jahr). 

### Background
* Vue.js is a JavaScript front-end framework that was built to organize and simplify web development.
* originally released in February 2014.
* It's focused on making ideas in web UI development (components, declarative UI, hot-reloading, time-travel debugging, etc.) more approachable. 
* It attempts to be less opinionated and thus easier for developers to pick up.
* It was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. 
    * He later summed up his thought process, "I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight."

### Notes
* I installed the Chrome Vue.js devtools. Chrome's built-in dev tools recommended it in console: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd
* I played with [CodePen](https://codepen.io), a browser-based text editor. 
    * It's very nice, but I switched to using Sublime Text after playing with it.
